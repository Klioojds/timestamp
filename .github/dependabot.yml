# Dependabot Configuration
# Automatically keeps dependencies up-to-date with security and version updates
# Documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file
#
# Grouping Strategy:
# - NPM: Separate groups for dev dependencies (testing, linting, build) and production
# - GitHub Actions: Single group for all workflow dependencies
# - Devcontainers: No grouping (can cause CLI issues with outdated command)
#
# Schedule: Weekly updates with cooldown to prevent PR flood
# Learn more about scheduling: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#scheduleinterval
